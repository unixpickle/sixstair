# Goal

My goal is to programmatically solve the "SixStair" puzzle (picture below). I first attempted to write the [solver in Dart](dart_attempt/), then I completed a solver in [C++](cpp/SixStairSolver). Currently, I am attempting to rewrite the solver in Go.

# Picture

Here is the puzzle in all its glory:
